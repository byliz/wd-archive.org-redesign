# wd-archive.org-redesign
Final group project with Winnie Chau and Xuechun Lu for Web Design class in which we created medium-fidelity pages of Archive.org and a redesign of the Met Museum landing page. I was in charge of the landing page, and it's one of the first pages I've ever made with a good-looking design.
